# Rent Wise 

The Property Portal is a web application that allows users to search for properties, list their own properties for sale or rent, and connect with potential buyers or tenants. This portal provides a convenient platform for users to explore, discover, and engage with real estate listings.

## Features

- Property Search: Users can search for properties based on various criteria such as location, property type, price range, and more.

- Property Listing: Users can list their own properties for sale or rent by providing property details, pricing information, and uploading photos.

- User Authentication: User registration and authentication functionality is implemented to ensure secure access to the portal.

- Property Management: Users can manage their listed properties, edit property information, mark properties as sold or rented, and remove listings.

- Messaging System: Users can communicate with each other through an integrated messaging system to inquire about properties or negotiate deals.

## Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or a frontend framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js)

- Backend: Node.js with Express.js (or any other backend framework of your choice)

- Database: MongoDB (or any other database of your choice)

- Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and authorization

- File Storage: Integration with cloud storage services like AWS S3 or Firebase Storage for storing property photos

- Additional Libraries and Tools: Use any relevant libraries or tools to enhance the functionality and user experience of the portal (e.g., Mongoose for MongoDB, Passport.js for authentication, Socket.io for real-time messaging)
